  The SERVIR project is led by Dr. Sohee Minsun Kim, Assistant Professor in the Urban Engineering Management program and Dr. Hiroyuki Miyazaki, 
  Project Assistant Professor at the Center of Spatial Information Science at the University of Tokyo 
  (currently seconded to the Remote Sensing &GIS program at AIT).
<br>
<br>
Funded by USAID, the objective of this grant program is to expand SERVIRâ€™s network of organizations, 
universities, and institutions in the Lower Mekong region and to generate innovative ideas for applying earth observation 
data and geospatial methods/tools for decision-making in the Lower Mekong region.
<br><br>
This Project aims to assess and address the future vulnerabilities to flood risk in the context of urban development and 
growth on a metropolitan region-wide scale in the Lower Mekong region.
<br><br>
This Project started from June 2017 and will continue until February 2018.
